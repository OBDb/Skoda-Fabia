  - name: "First Generation (Type 6Y)"
    start_year: 1999
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The first-generation Škoda Fabia, based on the Volkswagen Group's PQ24 platform shared with the Volkswagen Polo and SEAT Ibiza, marked a significant evolution for the Czech brand under Volkswagen ownership. Available as a five-door hatchback, estate (Combi), and later a four-door sedan (Sedan), the Fabia showcased substantially improved quality compared to pre-Volkswagen Škoda models. Measuring approximately 3.96 meters in length (4.22 meters for the Combi), the Fabia offered generous interior space for its compact exterior dimensions. Engine options included gasoline units ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 liters and diesel options centered around the 1.4 and 1.9 TDI, with power outputs ranging from 54 to 130 horsepower in the vRS performance model. The vRS, available exclusively with a 1.9 TDI diesel engine producing 130 horsepower, established a unique position as a performance diesel at a time when such combinations were uncommon. The interior featured straightforward, functional design with solid build quality and Škoda's emerging 'Simply Clever' features. A facelift in 2004 brought revised styling with updated headlights, grille, and improved interior materials. The first-generation Fabia established the model as a practical, reliable, and value-focused alternative to its Volkswagen Group siblings and competitors, helping to transform Škoda's market perception and achieve significant sales success across Europe."

    end_year: 2014
    description: "The second-generation Škoda Fabia, built on an updated version of the PQ24 platform, featured more distinctive styling with a taller, more upright profile emphasizing interior space and practicality. Available as a five-door hatchback and estate (Combi), with the sedan variant discontinued, the new Fabia maintained similar exterior dimensions to its predecessor at approximately 4.0 meters long (4.24 meters for the Combi). Engine options included gasoline units ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 liters, including the new 1.2 TSI turbocharged engine, and diesel options centered around the 1.4 and 1.6 TDI, with power outputs ranging from 60 to 132 horsepower in the vRS models. Unlike the diesel-only predecessor, the second-generation vRS was offered with a 1.4-liter twin-charged (supercharged and turbocharged) gasoline engine producing 180 horsepower, paired exclusively with a seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic transmission. The interior featured improved materials, more equipment options, and expanded 'Simply Clever' practical solutions. A facelift in 2010 brought updated styling with Škoda's new corporate grille design and additional equipment. The second-generation Fabia further developed the model's reputation for offering excellent value, practicality, and reliability, continuing its strong sales performance particularly in European markets where efficient small cars are popular."

    end_year: 2021
    description: "The third-generation Škoda Fabia was built on the Volkswagen Group's MQB-A0 platform shared with models like the Volkswagen Polo and SEAT Ibiza. With sharper, more angular styling aligned with Škoda's evolving design language, the new Fabia featured a wider stance and lower roofline than its predecessor, creating a more dynamic appearance. Available as a five-door hatchback and estate (Combi), the third-generation Fabia grew slightly to approximately 4.06 meters long (4.26 meters for the Combi). Engine options included gasoline units ranging from 1.0 MPI naturally aspirated to 1.0 and 1.2 TSI turbocharged engines, and diesel options including the 1.4 TDI, with power outputs ranging from 60 to 110 horsepower. Notably, no vRS performance variant was offered in this generation. Transmission options included five and six-speed manuals and a seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic. The interior featured a more modern design with improved materials, a central infotainment display with available smartphone connectivity, and expanded 'Simply Clever' features including umbrella storage under the passenger seat and a waste bin in the door pocket. A facelift in 2018 brought subtle exterior updates, LED lighting options, and additional technology including available blind-spot detection and rear traffic alert—advanced features for the segment. The third-generation Fabia continued the model's success by combining practicality and value with more sophisticated styling and technology, maintaining its position as one of Škoda's best-selling models."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (Type PJ)"
    start_year: 2021
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth-generation Škoda Fabia represents the most comprehensive redesign in the model's history, now fully utilizing the Volkswagen Group's MQB-A0 platform that underpins models like the current Volkswagen Polo and SEAT Ibiza. Significantly larger than its predecessor, the new Fabia grows to approximately 4.11 meters in length, approaching the size of earlier Škoda Octavia models, while the estate (Combi) variant was initially discontinued before returning in 2023. The exterior design features sharper lines, a more assertive front with a larger grille, and improved aerodynamics with a drag coefficient of 0.28. Engine options are exclusively gasoline, centered around the 1.0 MPI naturally aspirated and 1.0 TSI turbocharged three-cylinder engines, plus a 1.5 TSI four-cylinder in higher-spec models, with power outputs ranging from 65 to 150 horsepower. Transmission options include five and six-speed manuals and a seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic depending on engine selection. The interior represents a significant advancement with a more modern design featuring a free-standing infotainment screen up to 9.2 inches, an optional 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, and improved materials throughout. Technology options expanded to include features previously reserved for larger vehicles, such as dual-zone climate control, heated steering wheel, and advanced driver assistance systems including adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist. The 'Simply Clever' features that Škoda is known for are more numerous than ever, with up to 43 different practical solutions including a folding front passenger backrest, smartphone pockets on the front seatbacks, and a removable cupholder. The fourth-generation Fabia offers substantially more interior space, particularly rear legroom and cargo capacity, which increases to 380 liters (up 50 liters from the previous generation). This generation elevates the Fabia's position in the supermini segment, offering near-compact car space and features while maintaining competitive pricing, strengthening its appeal as a practical, value-focused choice with fewer compromises than typically associated with small cars."
